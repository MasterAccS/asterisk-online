## 🚀 Deployment Options

### 1. Netlify (Recommended)
- **File**: `netlify.toml` is configured
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Publish Directory**: `build`
- **Auto-redirects**: Configured for SPA routing

### 2. Vercel

npm install --save-dev gh-pages
npm run build
npx gh-pages -d build
```

### 4. Apache Server

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Common Deployment Issues

### Issue: "Module not found" or build errors
**Solution**: 
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build
```

### Issue: Blank page after deployment
**Solutions**:
1. Check if the `homepage` field in `package.json` matches your deployment URL
2. Ensure SPA redirects are configured (see deployment configs above)
3. Check browser console for JavaScript errors

### Issue: 404 errors on refresh
**Solution**: The app is a Single Page Application (SPA). Configure your server to serve `index.html` for all routes:
- Netlify: `_redirects` file included
- Apache: `.htaccess` file included  
- Vercel: `vercel.json` configured

### Issue: Console errors in production
**Solution**: All console statements have been removed from production build.
